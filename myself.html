    <h1 id="header">Things Which I Likes</h1>

    <!-- Cinema Section -->
    <div class="item">
        <h2>Cinema</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\Mowleshwaran\OneDrive\Desktop\FrontEnd\Images\BB-1-scaled.jpg" alt="Cinema" width="300">
        <p>I like cinema because it always teaches me something new about different aspects of life.</p>
        <p>Cinema is more than entertainment for me.</p>
        <p>It always enriches me.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Cricket Section -->
    <div class="item">
        <h2>Cricket</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\Mowleshwaran\OneDrive\Desktop\FrontEnd\Images\leagueaction5.webp" alt="Cricket" width="300">
        <p>Cricket is a game, but not just a game.</p>
        <p>It teaches you many things.</p>
        <p>For example, it teaches patience. If you are looking for results too quickly, cricket reminds you that they won’t always come right away.</p>
        <p>During that time, it teaches you to remain patient.</p>
        <p>It also teaches you that some things take time to happen.</p>

        <p>No matter what I am going through in my life, going to the gym helps me forget all the worries running through my mind.</p>
        <p>The gym makes me feel refreshed and light.</p>
        <p>For me, the gym is not just a place — it is like a friend.</p>

        <h2>Interviews</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\Mowleshwaran\OneDrive\Desktop\FrontEnd\Images\OIP (12).jpeg" alt="Interview" width="300">
        <p>I started watching interviews regularly over the last two years.</p>
        <p>I enjoy watching interviews because I learn from the experiences of the people being interviewed.</p>
        <p>Listening to their stories and journeys has given me new perspectives about life.</p>
